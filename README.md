===ESP8266 InfluxDB Data logger ( DS18B20 Sensor )===

This sketch can be used to create a data logger with a single DS18B20.

Fill in your variables ( SSID, Password, InfluxDB server ) and you're ready to log!

Please note, NTP code is available because this is needed for some logging platforms. At this moment it is not used.
